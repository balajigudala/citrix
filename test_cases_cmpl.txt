COMPILATION OF AIE-ML CODE AND TESTED IN BOARD (VEK280)

Generated the binaries of test.c file, which contains test cases

make linux     (Run this in aieml-tests repo)

Verify for binary file i.e aieml_test in build_linux directoy

Acquire the baord and copy the binaries by using ssh

ssh username@I.P:<from>  <to>

then run the copied binary.




COMPILATION OF AIE-ML CODE AND RUNNING IN SIMULATION

Change the normal login developer login

ssh xsjrdevl171

change the terminal mode to bash

bash

change the directory to aieml_tests repo

verify the README.md (how to compile for AI2PS board type)

run the script file 

source /proj/xsjsswstaff/sankarji/aie-arch/aie-arch-env-files/aie2ps-arch.sh

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/aie-rt/driver/src:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

for library generation 

make AIE_GEN=5 systemc

To run the generated binaries of test cases in simulation 

make AIE_GEN=5 run_sim

kill the processes created by command "iss_fst_bin"
use "top" command 
top -u "username"
kill -9 "pid" (or) 
killall iss_fst_bin
